## Overview and Origin
Company: UiPath

Founded: UiPath was founded and incorporated in the year 2005 

Founded By: The company was founded in Romania by Daniel Dines and Marius Tîrcă.

According to a blog on the UiPath website Daniel Dines came up with the idea of UiPath to "help humans reduce the time and stress that result from menial, repetitive administrative tasks." Him and his partner recruited a team of people and they began working as a 10 person team out of an apartment in Romania to try and bring this idea to life. 

When doing my research I could not find how they secured their funding in the beginning. I found the companies history of funding going back to August 2015 when they recieved $1.6 million in inital seed funding from a few different venture capital groups. The funding and investment they recieved grew exponentially. In 2018 they rasied $225 million and recieved a $3 billion valuation. The last round of fund raising they did brought in $750 million and they were given a $35 billion post money valuation. Between August 2015 and Febraury 2021 the company recieved a total of $1,952,600,000 in funding.
