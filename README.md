## Overview and Origin
Company: UiPath

Founded: UiPath was founded and incorporated in the year 2005 

Founded By: The company was founded in Romania by Daniel Dines and Marius Tîrcă.

According to a blog on the UiPath website Daniel Dines came up with the idea of UiPath to "help humans reduce the time and stress that result from menial, repetitive administrative tasks." Him and his partner recruited a team of people and they began working as a 10 person team out of an apartment in Romania to try and bring this idea to life. 

When doing my research I could not find how they secured their funding in the beginning. I found the companies history of funding going back to August 2015 when they recieved $1.6 million in inital seed funding from a few different venture capital groups. The funding and investment they recieved grew exponentially. In 2018 they rasied $225 million and recieved a $3 billion valuation. The last round of fund raising they did brought in $750 million and they were given a $35 billion post money valuation. Between August 2015 and Febraury 2021 the company recieved a total of $1,952,600,000 in funding. 

## Business Activities
The company is trying to solve the problem of humans and businesses doing repetitive tasks by replacing it with a software that can automate and stremaline those processes. This allows people to focus more on other difficult tasks and boosts productivity within the company.

UiPath appeals to customers accross a wide variety of industries as their software is capable of a lot of different things. On UiPath's website under "solutions" they break it down by industry, department, and technology. The industries they serve consist of banking & financial services, customer experience, healthcare, high tech, insurance, life sceiences, public sectors, manufacturing, retail, and telecom. If you take just health care and banking from the industries they serve, both of them combined have almost a $3 trillion market size. A market size like this provides UiPath with endless opportunites and they serve many more industries outside of just banking and healthcare.
